                        America's one-man army. Fighting for the red, white and blue for over 60 years, Captain America is
                        the living, breathing symbol of freedom and liberty. A hero for our time, and all time.</p>

                <p class="lead">“For a hero is someone who is selfless. Think about it, friends. Superman, Luke Skywalker, and Captain America.
                    They are helping others. They aren’t only thinking for themselves. They are reaching out beyond themselves.”
                    ― Mark Andrew Poe</p>
